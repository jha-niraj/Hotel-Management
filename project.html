                <p>The service at the Hotel Monteleone was exceptional. There was absolutely no issue that was not addressed timely and with satisfactory results. We were particulary impressed with how the hotel staff anticipated our needs. Numerous conference attendees commented on the quality of the food, the quality of the service and overall positive attitude toward the conference site.</p>

                <p>The hotel staff was beyond exceptional. During the past twenty years I have hosted hundreds of events at dozens of hotels and I can’t recall ever having things run as smoothly as they did for us at the Monteleone. We had very few “last minute changes” but those we had were handled flawlessly.</p>
